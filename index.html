        <h1>Murphy Brown The Dog</h1>
        <small>By Kasey Knudsen</small>
        <p>
          Murphy is your basic labradoodle--great on some days, and a terrorist on other days. He was a famous
          sock thief for the first 2 years of his life until he decided to move on to smaller and better things,
          like ear plugs and tampons. He loves to snuggle and shake hands, hump his bed and bark at the mail man,
          eat fresh pasta and run away from me when I try to clean his ears, and most of all, he loves to stand
          between us and the kitchen counter when we're cooking, just in case any crumbs fall on the floor. 
          He was born on March 17th, 2017, St Patrick's day. We named him Murphy Brown after both 
          the beloved sitcom, and the delectable Irish stout.

        <p>
          It takes <span><i>several</i></span> cookies and coaxing to get Murphy into the bath,
          but once he's in, he's quite well behaved. Once he's out, he runs around the apartment destroying 
          everything in his path.
